# Freelancing_Portal
This is a digital marketplace that will connect talented professionals with economic
opportunities and give organizations access to affordable and low risk human capital. We can
access a larger talent pool from around the world, which allows us to find the specific talent.
Freelancers can deliver high quality work due to their past work portfolio to make sure they are
the right fit. By successfully completing your project, freelancers build their reputation, expand
their portfolio, and increase their chance of future employment. Freelance platform defines two
communities, Employer and Freelancer. Employers post the project with all necessary details and
upload it within minutes. Now freelancers browse apt projects and bid for it. After freelancer
completed the project based on the winner selected by employer, employers accept that
completion and release the payment. As well as employer can hire the freelancer. Technologies
used in developing the frontend and are JavaScript, Boostrap, and PHP. We connect backend
